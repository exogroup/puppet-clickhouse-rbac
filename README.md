# puppet-clickhouse-rbac

### Module Description

The `clickhouse-rbac` puppet module allows management of ClickHouse resources such as users, grants,
quotas and settings profiles using SQL statements.

### Usage

#### Users
```
clickhouse_user { 'foo':
  ensure        => 'present',
  password_hash => sha256('bar'),
  host_ip       => [ '::/0' ],
  host_names    => [],
  host_like     => [],
  host_regexp   => [],
  profile       => 'myprofile',
  distributed   => false,
}
```

`ensure`: Defines if the resource should be _present_ or _absent_  
`password_hash`: SHA256 password hash for the user. ClickHouse supports other types of hashes, but this module only supports SHA256.  
`host_ip`: Array of allowed user host IPs. (default: `::/0`)
`host_names`: Array of allowed user host names.  
`host_like`: Array of allowed user host LIKEs.  
`host_regexp`: Array of allowed user host regular expressions.  
`profile`: Name of the settings profile to associate to the user.  
`distributed`: Determine whether to use the `ON CLUSTER` statement for queries. (default: `true`)

#### Grants
```
clickhouse_grant { 'foo/mydb.mytable':
  ensure      => 'present',
  user        => 'foo',
  table       => 'mydb.mytable',
  privileges  => [
    'INSERT',
    'SELECT',
  ],
  options     => 'GRANT',
  distributed => false,
```

This type is highly based on `mysql_grant`, so it should work similarly.  
The resource name must match `<user>/<table>` parameters, otherwise it'll throw an error.

`ensure`: Defines if the resource should be _present_ or _absent_  
`user`: User to apply the grant on.  
`table`: Table to apply the grant on. Must be in the format `<dbname>.<table>` and wildcard for table can be used `<dbname>.*`.  
`privileges`: List of privileges to assign to the grant. Can be specified as Array or String.  
`distributed`: Determine whether to use the `ON CLUSTER` statement for queries. (default: `true`)  

See:
* https://ClickHouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant/

#### Profiles
```
clickhouse_profile { 'myprofile':
  ensure      => 'present',
  settings    => {
    'readonly' => 1,
  }
  distributed => true,
}
```

`ensure`: Defines if the resource should be _present_ or _absent_  
`settings`: Hash containing settings for the profile.  
`distributed`: Determine whether to use the `ON CLUSTER` statement for queries. (default: `true`)

#### Quotas
```
clickhouse_quota { 'myquota':
  ensure             => 'present',
  interval           => 3600,
  max_queries        => 10,
  max_errors         => 20,
  max_read_rows      => 30,
  max_read_bytes     => 40,
  max_result_rows    => 50, 
  max_result_bytes   => 60,
  max_execution_time => 70,
  user               => 'myuser',
  distributed        => true,
}
```

`ensure`: Defines if the resource should be _present_ or _absent_  
`user`: User(s) to apply the quota on.  
`interval`: Interval duration in seconds (default: `3600`)  
`max_*`: Please refer to the link below for further details on those parameters.  
`distributed`: Determine whether to use the `ON CLUSTER` statement for queries. (default: `true`)

### Facts

The module provides some useful facts regarding the current ClickHouse node.

`clickhouse_cluster_name`: Name of the cluster as defined in `metrika.xml`.  
`clickhouse_shard_num`: Current node's shard number.  
`clickhouse_replica_num`: Current node's replica number.  
`clickhouse_version`: Current node's ClickHouse server version.  

### Known issues/limitations

#### clickhouse_user

* The password hash for an user is read from the filesystem because, at the current time, thereâ€™s no way
  to get it by executing SQL statements. There might be some corner cases in which this might not work:
  eg. using an SSH tunnel to reach CH from another machine, executing puppet as an unprivileged user
  which has no read access to CH `access` directory.
* Support for SHA256 password hash only. Should be easy to implement a new hash type.
* There might be some issues when specifying loopback addresses for the `host_*` parameters due to ClickHouse
  converting internally those addresses to LOCAL. Similar issues might be seen when specifying overlapping
  addresses/subnets.

#### clickhouse_quota

* Quotas are recreated on update instead of being ALTERed. This is due to ClickHouse creating multiple
  rows which are not easy to manage when updating an existent quota with a different interval duration.
  This has the drawback of assigning a new ID to the quota each time it's changed.

#### clickhouse_profile

* A workaround is required for https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/18231 or at least prevent execution
  depending on the server version. This issue could be hit when removing a `SETTINGS PROFILE` which has already
  been assigned to an user.
